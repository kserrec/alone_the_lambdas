# Core milestone acceptance

This document maps every first-milestone completion criterion to observed
evidence in the repository. The authoritative requirements remain the three
[specifications](specifications/README.md); this is their verification index,
not a replacement.

Verified on 2026-08-24 with:

```sh
raco make core/*.rkt readers/*.rkt
./run-all-tests.sh
```

The result was 2,889 passing assertions across 18 test files, followed by a
clean structural scan of all 16 production modules.

## Base specification criteria

| Completion criterion | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Lists are explicit Michaelson-style List objects. | [`lists-test.rkt`](../tests/lists-test.rkt) checks the tag/payload representation, proper tails, traversal, and constructor boundary. |
| Empty List is not raw false. | [`lists-test.rkt`](../tests/lists-test.rkt) distinguishes `NIL` from Bool and Nat; [`acceptance-test.rkt`](../tests/acceptance-test.rkt) observes its `LIST` tag. |
| Numbers are scalable binary digit Lists. | [`binary-nat-test.rkt`](../tests/binary-nat-test.rkt) covers normalized MSB-first bits and larger arithmetic; [`acceptance-test.rkt`](../tests/acceptance-test.rkt) constructs 100 as seven binary digits. |
| Church numerals are used only for tiny tags and discriminants. | Structural check: [`tags.rkt`](../core/tags.rkt) owns Church zero through six; Error kinds and argument positions reuse that closed metadata range, while [`binary-nat.rkt`](../core/binary-nat.rkt) owns all ordinary numeric representation and arithmetic. |
| Arbitrary-arity functions use one generalized curried checker. | [`typecheck-test.rkt`](../tests/typecheck-test.rkt) exercises zero-, one-, two-, three-, and five-argument signatures through `make-typed-function`. |
| No arity-specific checker exists. | [`check-purity.rkt`](../tooling/check-purity.rkt) rejects numbered `type-check` and `make-typed-function` identifiers; [`purity-test.rkt`](../tests/purity-test.rkt) proves both patterns fail. |
| Early type failures preserve remaining curried arity. | [`typecheck-test.rkt`](../tests/typecheck-test.rkt) checks exact absorber depth and ignored-argument laziness at every position; strict operation suites repeat this at their public boundaries. |
| Errors preserve roots and accumulate structured frames. | [`errors-test.rkt`](../tests/errors-test.rkt) checks root identity and newest-first frame storage; [`error-reader-test.rkt`](../tests/error-reader-test.rkt) checks named causal rendering. |
| Result represents expected failure separately from Error. | [`result-test.rkt`](../tests/result-test.rkt) and [`acceptance-test.rkt`](../tests/acceptance-test.rkt) distinguish `DIV` by zero as Result Err from a wrong argument as contract Error. |
| Typed `if` consumes tagged Bool values. | [`typed-logic-test.rkt`](../tests/typed-logic-test.rkt) checks strict condition typing, polymorphic branches, absorber shape, and divergent unselected branches. |
| Char uses binary payloads from 0 through 255. | [`chars-test.rkt`](../tests/chars-test.rkt) checks normalized payloads, both bounds, rejection of 256, constants, comparisons, and observation. |
| String is a typed List of typed Char values. | [`strings-test.rkt`](../tests/strings-test.rkt) checks the representation, recursive Char invariant, proper tails, and invalid elements. |
| String operations are lambda computations. | [`strings-test.rkt`](../tests/strings-test.rkt) covers every raw and strict algorithm; the purity scan checks [`strings.rkt`](../core/strings.rkt) under the same host-form ban as the rest of production. |
| All core computation remains pure untyped lambda calculus. | [`check-purity.rkt`](../tooling/check-purity.rkt) scans every `core/*.rkt` file for non-unary lambdas, host literals and computational forms, explicit `host`, host-style function definitions, and arity-specific checkers. The command runs after every test file in [`run-all-tests.sh`](../run-all-tests.sh) and in CI. |

## Addenda and Phase 12 refinements

| Refined requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Production computation reduces to variables, unary lambda, and application after mechanical expansion. | [`macros-test.rkt`](../tests/macros-test.rkt) checks curried expansion; [`purity-test.rkt`](../tests/purity-test.rkt) proves multi-formal lambdas and representative host shortcuts are rejected. |
| Readers are a one-way observation boundary. | Structural check: reader modules may use host values and formatting, but no production module imports `readers/`; the dependency direction is recorded in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md). |
| Error frames contain structured function-name Strings. | [`function-names.rkt`](../core/function-names.rkt) contains pure typed constants; [`error-reader-test.rkt`](../tests/error-reader-test.rkt) verifies all 43 names, every corresponding strict mismatch boundary, and nested propagation. |
| Diagnostics preserve structured data until observation. | [`error.rkt`](../readers/error.rkt) alone flattens roots and frames; its tests cover all root kinds, type names, raw fallback output, and causal order. |
| Internal names expose raw and typed layers without underscore collision workarounds. | Structural check: production APIs use `raw-*` and `typed-*`; canonical `if` is exported at its module boundary. The remaining standalone `lambda`/`let`/`cons` surface is explicitly next-milestone work, as permitted by the naming addendum. |
| No implicit host boundary exists in this milestone. | `host` is absent from production and is itself a forbidden production head in the purity checker. [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) defers the single explicit boundary and standalone language surface. |

## What this milestone does not claim

The repository is a verified core implementation hosted by Lazy Racket. It
does not yet provide the standalone `#lang`, literal syntax, command-line
runner, effects, networking, or the explicit `host` primitive. Those features
belong to the next milestone and must preserve this core boundary.
